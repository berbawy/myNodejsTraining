# 0. Calculator Node

## Phase 1

   Create a app.js that require another file called `calculator.js` When we call node `app.js` we should show in the console the following:
   `The sum of 3 & 7 is: 10 The multiplication of 3 & 7 is: 21`
   `app.js` should only show in the console the result of calling the functions sum & multiplication
   These methods should be defined (and exported) in `calculator.js`

## Phase 2

   Create a folder called operations and create in every folder a file exporting every operation needed in the main `app.js` file
   `app.js` `operations/ sum.js` `multiplication.js` `substraction.js` `division.js`

## Phase 3

  Install the module moment and use it to show the current time in this way:
  `Today is : Monday, October 31st 2016, 10:08:34 am The sum of 3 & 7 is: 10 The multiplication of 3 & 7 is: 21`
